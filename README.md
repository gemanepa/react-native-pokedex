## Pre-requisites
1. NodeJS installed
2. NPM installed
3. Brew installed
4. Python installed

## Running E2E Tests
To run the E2E Detox tests you'll have to do a bit of setup which can be found on [this](https://blog.expo.io/testing-expo-apps-with-detox-and-react-native-testing-library-7fbdbb82ac87) blog post. In summary you'll need to do the following:
1. `brew tap wix/brew`
2. `brew install --HEAD applesimutils`
3. `npm install -g detox-cli`
and then you're good to go! Detox has already been configured to run with Expo and TypeScript in this project.

On a first test run, you'll need to run `npm run test:clean` to pull the IPA of the expo app.
After this first pull, you can run the following to get the tests going:
1. `expo start`, this script will never finish
2. In a different shell, run `expo ios` to open the app in the ios simulator
3. Run `npm run test` and the tests should start!

Code coverage is difficult at the moment as getting `ts-jest`, `expo` and `react-native` to work together is tricky.
